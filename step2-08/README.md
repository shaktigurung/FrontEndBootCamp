Combine Reducers

This lesson is just a helper to make the process of writing reducers use less boilerplate code. This step briefly introduces to a world of helpers in writing Redux code.

Our Redux store so far has this shape, roughly:

```js
const state = {
  todos: {
    id0: {
      label: 'hello',
      completed: false
    },
    id1: {
      label: 'world',
      completed: true
    }
  },

  filter: 'all'
};
```

As the application grows in complexity, so will the shape of the store. Currently, the store captures two separate but related ideas: the todo items and the selected filter. The reducers should follow the shape of the store. Think of reducers as part of the store itself and are responsible to update a single part of the store based on actions that they receive as a second argument. As complexity of state grows, we split these reducers:

```ts
function todoReducer(state: Store['todos'] = {}, action: any) {
  // reduce on the todos part of the state tree
}

function filterReducer(state: Store['filter'] = 'all', action: any) {
  // reduce on the filter flag
}

// Then use the redux-provided combineReducers() to combine them
export const reducer = combineReducers({
  todos: todoReducer,
  filter: filterReducer
});
```

`combineReducers` handles the grunt-work of sending *actions* to each combined reducer. Therefore, when an action arrives, each reducer is given the opportunity to modify its own state tree based on the incoming action.

# Exercise

1. open up `exercise/src/reducers/index.ts`

2. implement the `filterReducer` function with a switch / case statement - it is contrived to have a switch case for ONE condition, but serves to be a good exercise here

3. replace the export reducer function with the help of the `combineReducer()` function from `redux`

# Bonus Exercise

The Redux team came up with `redux-starter-kit` to address a lot of boilerplate concerns. They also embed the immer library to make it nicer to write reducer functions. So, let's try out `immer`! Look at this example: https://github.com/mweststrate/immer#reducer-example

1. import immer into the `exercise/src/reducers/pureFunction.ts` file

2. replace the implementation of the pure functions with the help of immer's `produce()`

3. run `npm test` in the root folder to see if it still works!

4. look at the web app to make sure it still works!
