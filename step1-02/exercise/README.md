2. Add 4 list items with class `todo` inside of that list with the following content
   `<label><input type="checkbox" /> <span class="title"> Todo </span> </label>`
3. Add a span and a button to your footer
4. Span content should be `4 items left` and button should say `Clear Completed` and have a class of `submit`
